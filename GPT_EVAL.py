1) Informativeness: Whether the response incorporates rich knowledge

3) Relevance: Whether the response provides explanations about the recommended item with its features relevant to the dialog context

Grading rules:
- Be conservative when assigning scores. Do not give 4 or 5 unless the response clearly excels. 
- If a criterion is only partially satisfied, reduce the score (e.g., give 1 or 2 instead of 3). 
- Only responses with strong, explicit evidence of meeting the criterion should receive scores above 3. 
- Use 0 freely for responses that fail to meet the requirement at all.

1) Informativeness: Whether the response incorporates rich knowledge
2) Fluency: Whether the response includes diverse words
3) Relevance: Whether the response recommends proper items and their explanatory features relevant to the dialog context

Guideline for scoring:
- 1 point: The response is very poor. It fails almost entirely to meet this criterion.
- 2 points: The response partially meets this criterion. It shows some adequacy but remains weak or insufficient.
- 3 points: The response meets the minimum requirement for this criterion. It is acceptable but lacks depth, richness, or distinct strengths.
- 4 points: The response performs well on this criterion. It is clear, specific, natural, and contextually appropriate, but not outstanding.
- 5 points: The response fully excels in this criterion. It is rich, highly natural, and strongly aligned with the context. Award only when it clearly stands out.

EVAL_two_dim = """I will provide you with a dialog and a response generated by a Conversational Recommender System (CRS).

Dialog:
%s

Response:
%s

Evaluate the response along two dimensions: (A) Recommendation Quality and (B) Explanation Quality.

A. Recommendation Quality
1) Validity: Does the recommended item align with the user’s preferences expressed in the dialog?

B. Explanation Quality
1) Informativeness: Does the explanation incorporate rich and meaningful knowledge about the item?
2) Fluency: Is the explanation natural, coherent, and expressed with varied wording?
3) Relevance: Does the explanation highlight item features that are directly relevant to the dialog context?

Scoring: Use a 1–5 scale for each criterion.
- 1 point: Very poor. Fails almost entirely to meet the criterion.
- 2 points: Weak. Shows partial adequacy but remains insufficient.
- 3 points: Moderate. Meets the minimum requirement but lacks depth or strength.
- 4 points: Good. Clear, specific, and contextually appropriate, though not outstanding.
- 5 points: Excellent. Rich, highly natural, and strongly aligned with the context. Award only if it clearly stands out.
